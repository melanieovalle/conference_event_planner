# Conference Event Planner
Created a dynamic user interface that updates in real time based on user selections components for venue, audio-visual items, and meal options. 

Used Redux Toolkit slices to manage different parts of the application's states by implementing Redux actions, reducers and the Redux store to increment and decrement stored values and dynamically display those values. The website calculates and displays costs using arrays and the map() function to iterate over the arrays. It also contains a dynamic table to show selected products, displaying the item names, unit cost, quantity, subtotal for that item, and total costs based on user selections.

Adapted from the IBM event planner coding template.
